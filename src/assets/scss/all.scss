/*
 * SASS vs. SCSS vs. CSS (http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax):
 * =====================
 *
 *   • There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and
 *     used throughout this reference, is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This means
 *     that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning. This
 *     syntax is enhanced with the Sass features described below. Files using this syntax
 *     have the .scss extension.
 *
 *   • The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just “SASS”),
 *     provides a more concise way of writing CSS. It uses indentation rather than brackets
 *     to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate
 *     properties. Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.
 *
 *   • tl;dr:
 *     =====
 *     - SASS is the old (python like) syntax, SCSS is the new syntax.
 *     - All CSS files are valid SCSS files.
