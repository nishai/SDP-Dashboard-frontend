Components are intended to be reusable snippets
of code only. Anything that doesnt fall under
the categories of:
    - page
    - layout

Please move globally defined components (done
inside /plugins/globalComponents.js) into the "global"
folder so that this is easy to see.
    - only extremely popular things should have this done

the "beufy" folder is intended for custom bulma component
implementations, that are not covered by "buefy".
